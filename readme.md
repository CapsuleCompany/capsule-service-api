= SPEC-001: Service Marketplace App
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The service marketplace app is designed to connect service providers with customers, similar to how DoorDash connects food providers with customers and Shopify supports merchants in selling products online. This platform will cater specifically to various service industries such as home cleaning, plumbing, tutoring, and more. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for both service providers and customers, enabling easy service listing, booking, and payment processing.


== Requirements

The service marketplace app will include the following core functionalities and features:

=== Must Have
* Service providers can create a profile and offer services.
* Ability for service providers to add a logo, background header image, and customize their service page.
* Customers can select a service, add details, and checkout.
* Option for service providers to require payment at the time of scheduling.
* Service providers can generate and share a link or QR code to their service page.
* Customers can book services without creating an account (optional account creation after checkout).
* Essential customer details collected during checkout: first name, last name, email, and phone number.
* Scheduled services are automatically added to the service provider's calendar.
* Messaging system for customers to communicate with service providers, integrated with an AI assistant for providers.

=== Should Have
* Mobile and web platform support.
* Real-time notifications for booking confirmations and messages.
* User-friendly interface for both providers and customers.

=== Could Have
* Integration with third-party calendars (e.g., Google Calendar).
* Customer reviews and ratings for service providers.
* Loyalty programs or discounts for repeat customers.

=== Won't Have
* Integration with physical product sales or delivery (focus solely on services).


== Method

To address the requirements, the service marketplace app will be developed using a microservices architecture with Django, React, and PostgreSQL. This will allow for scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

=== Architecture Design

The architecture will consist of the following components:

=== Database Schema

The database will be designed with the following tables:

* Users
  - id: UUID
  - first_name: String
  - last_name: String
  - email: String
  - phone_number: String
  - role: Enum (Customer, Provider)
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - updated_at: Timestamp

* Services
  - id: UUID
  - provider_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Users)
  - name: String
  - description: Text
  - logo_url: String
  - background_image_url: String
  - price: Decimal
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - updated_at: Timestamp

* Bookings
  - id: UUID
  - service_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Services)
  - customer_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Users)
  - scheduled_time: Timestamp
  - status: Enum (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Cancelled)
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - updated_at: Timestamp

* Payments
  - id: UUID
  - booking_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Bookings)
  - amount: Decimal
  - status: Enum (Pending, Completed, Failed)
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - updated_at: Timestamp

* Messages
  - id: UUID
  - booking_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Bookings)
  - sender_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Users)
  - receiver_id: UUID (Foreign Key to Users)
  - content: Text
  - created_at: Timestamp
  - updated_at: Timestamp

=== Algorithms and Workflows

1. **Service Creation Workflow**
  - Provider registers and creates a profile.
  - Provider adds service details including logo, background image, and price.
  - Service is saved in the database and becomes available for booking.

2. **Booking Workflow**
  - Customer selects a service and provides necessary details.
  - Customer checks out and makes a payment if required.
  - Booking is created and scheduled time is added to provider's calendar.
  - Confirmation notification is sent to both customer and provider.

3. **Messaging Workflow**
  - Customer sends a message regarding a booking.
  - Message is processed and stored in the database.
  - Provider's AI assistant responds or notifies the provider.
  - Real-time updates are provided to both parties.


== Implementation

To implement the service marketplace app, follow these steps:

=== Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Required Software:**
   - Python (3.x)
   - Node.js and npm
   - PostgreSQL
   - Django
   - React

2. **Set Up the Backend:**
   - Create a new Django project and application.
   - Configure PostgreSQL as the database in Django settings.
   - Set up Django REST framework for API development.
   - Create models, serializers, and views based on the provided schema.
   - Implement user authentication using Django's built-in auth system.

3. **Set Up the Frontend:**
   - Create a new React project using Create React App.
   - Set up routing with React Router.
   - Design components for user interface including service listings, booking forms, and user profiles.
   - Integrate with the backend API using Axios or Fetch API.

=== Step 2: Building Core Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

2. **Service Provider Dashboard:**
   - Create a dashboard for service providers to manage their profiles, services, and bookings.
   - Implement CRUD operations for services.

3. **Service Booking System:**
   - Develop the booking workflow where customers can select services, add details, and checkout.
   - Implement payment processing using a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.

4. **Messaging System:**
   - Create a messaging interface for customers to communicate with service providers.
   - Integrate an AI assistant for automated responses and assistance.

5. **Notification System:**
   - Implement real-time notifications for booking confirmations and messages.
   - Use WebSockets or a service like Pusher for real-time updates.

=== Step 3: Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for backend functionality using Django's test framework.
   - Write integration and end-to-end tests for the frontend using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Perform manual testing to ensure all features work as expected.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Set up a production environment using Docker for containerization.
   - Use a cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Heroku for deployment.
   - Configure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

=== Step 4: Post-Deployment

1. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track application performance.
   - Set up logging and alerting for error tracking and resolution.

2. **Feedback and Iteration:**
   - Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
   - Plan and implement iterative enhancements based on user needs and performance metrics.
